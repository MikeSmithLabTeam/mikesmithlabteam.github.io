  "summary": "The strength of interparticle interactions in a granular system controls how a collection of insulating particles flow, cohere and fragment. Forces due to electrostatic charging, particularly in free-fall or low gravity environments, can dominate the static and dynamic interactions with important implications for understanding natural and industrial processes. Models of electrostatic charging in insulators usually assume that with sufficient collisions the charge generated on the surface is spread relatively evenly. As such modelling the system by a single charge located at the particle centre equivalent to the sum of all the surface charge is assumed to be sufficient. In this study we checked this assumption experimentally and found that this has some serious deficiencies...",
    "full": "Our study shows that shaking of homogeneous, spherical particles can result in a non-uniform surface charge distribution. The measured dipole moment and torque for each particle are found to be strongly correlated. However, our model shows that to predict the torque and force requires one to consider the full surface charge distribution. This overlooked torque is not only significant, but would amplify attractive interactions through particle reorientation. "

Yield stress fluids are commonly found in such applications but understanding the affect of their rheology on the break-up behaviour is still poorly understood. Yield stress fluids generally occur in two types: 'Simple yield stress fluids' where the stress at which the fluid starts to flow is a constant and 'Thixotropic yield stress fluids' in which the properties can evolve with time, known as aging. Our study considered the role of aging in a yield stress fluid known as Laponite on the break-up properties of a sample subjected to extensional strain (a mode appropriate for studying processes such as droplet detachment)...",
      "full": "Our study showed that as samples age the necking of the midpoint becomes more pronounced. Through comparisons of the thinning behaviour with more conventional shear rheology we found that the dynamics are influenced by the static yield stress but are apparently insensitive to the yield strain of the samples. Samples accumulate significant plastic deformations prior to complete yielding which has signficant implications for the brittle / ductile nature of the break-up. "

It links to the broader questions of how non-equilibrium systems which don't obey conventional thermodynamics can be described by statistical models. Many of these studies have been carried out using model spherical or circular disk shaped particles. However, as the examples given above show, many biological systems are far from round. Using simulations we explored the importance of particle shape on the phase behaviour of active particles, using a model where the geometry could be tuned continuously....",
      "full": "Our study showed that 'dumbell-like' particles can crystallize, however the addition of small side lobes results in clustering being completely eliminated. However, as the side lobes continue to increase in size the particles cluster in a disorganised fashion with many similarities to the MIPs scenario -  clustering occurs due to the imbalance in arrival times v escape times. Curiously however as the lobes increase still further in size the clustering again reduces. This is due to exotic states created by particles that become locked in spinning configurations reducing their effective mobility. We provide a simple model that predicts where these features of the phase diagram occur as a function of particle geometry."

Whilst 3D hard spheres undergo a first order phase transition it is well known that in 2D the transition proceeds via an intermediate known as the hexatic phase, with at least one step undergoing a continuous phase transition. Recent work has focussed on trying to understand how such phase transitions are modified by features found in real systems, such as attractive interactions or particle shape. In this work we looked at the possible role of an underlying surface, consisting of a hexagonal pattern of dimples. The structure of boundaries was also manipulated in a similar way resulting in both order or disorder creating edges.",

Whereas a flat surface exhibited in the expected two-step phase transition via a hexatic intermediate, the introduction of dimples resulted in a first order phase transition. This means that the coexisting liquid and crystal phases have a strong interfacial energy and also latent heat. In addition to the changes in phase transition the use of orderphilic / phobic edges was also shown to be able to manipulate the wetting of the experiment's edge by either the crystal or liquid phase respectively. This is one of the first direct experimental observations of wetting controlled purely by order rather than energetics and has links to a recent theory of orderphobicity, which is a generalised theory of the same physics responsible for the hydrophobic effect."

It is also algorithm agnostic providing a uniform interface to 3 commonly used approaches to tracking. It therefore provides an open source solution for new users to use particle tracking as a part of their research. At the same time the python code base is designed to make extending the project extremely simple.

As the particles bounce on the rough surface they travel laterally giving rise to a diffusive like motion. There is a frictional \"drag\" that occurs as they move across the surface. When the particles collide with one another the dynamics depend on the loss in the collision. This paper explores how inter-surface /particle collisions couple with the surface friction. This gives rise to a large loss that is often ignored in simple models or in comparisons of experiments...",
      "full": "When two particles collide the loss of the collision is usually understood in terms of the coefficients of restitution (normal and tangential). For this reason these numbers are often quoted in studies since it enables experimentalists to compare different experiments.  Simple simulation models also often use the Langevin equation which assumes that collisions and the frictional interaction between the surface and the ball are completely separable. When a ball rolls across a surface its linear velocity is related to its angular velocity such that v=R$omega$. This results in no friction. However following a head on collision although the linear velocity reverses sign the angular velocity does not. This results in a large difference in velocity between the contact point of the ball and the linear velocity resulting in a large frictional force slowing the ball. From the perspective of a quasi-2d experiment this means that the \"effective\" coefficient of restitution is dependent upon the frictional interaction with the surface."

Previous studies have suggested that this behaviour can be understood in terms of viscous dissipation arising from normal stresses at the contact line. Using a detailed study of the contact angle at different flow velocities we show that the additional force acting at the contact line arises from an interaction of the polymer with the surface."

      "full":"Spherulites consist of a central core surrounded by birefringent fibres (known as amyloid fibrils). Typically ~5-30μm in diameter they can be observed by optical microscopy and easily distinguished by their characteristic maltese cross pattern seen when viewed under crossed polarisers. However, we have discovered that under a particular set of conditions (10 mgml-1 BPI, pH ~2.8, T ~68°C, 25mM NaCl) giant amyloid spherulites (GAS) can grow to diameters of up to ~ 1 mm . These huge spherulites when viewed under crossed polarisers in addition to the maltese cross, feature distinctive coloured patterns (Isochromes) which change with the size and density of the spherulite. Such rings have been observed in other systems such as fish eye lenses and nematic liquid crystal drops and appear to be related to the rather unusual radially oriented birefringence of their internal structure. Using a ray tracing technique we model the optical path of rays through these spherulites. Taking into account refraction and the radially oriented birefringence of the amyloid fibrils, we elucidate the origin of these beautiful patterns. Modelling these optical patterns we are able to elucidate structural information about the arrangement of fibrils and measure the intrinsic and form birefringence of the consitituent fibrils."

Together with our collaborators we discovered that the number and size of spherulites measured with polarized light microscopy were related to changes in the colloidal stability of the solution and fibril nucleation times (measured by static light scattering). Importantly, changes in pH between 1.75 and 2 were found to result in a dramatic decrease in the spherulite radii, which were related to differences in the conformational stability of the protein. Moreover, estimates of the final spherulite volume fraction clearly indicate that amyloid spherulite formation is the dominant pathway for insulin aggregation in HCl solutions at low pH and protein concentrations below 5 mg/ml, with the balance shifting towards fibrils as the concentration increases.",

      "full": "Using Atomic force microscopy, we were able to show that the particle arrangements on the top and bottom surfaces of colloidal films, dried on glass substrates were different. The interface prevents particle rearrangements at the bottom of the film, leading to a mismatch strain between upper and lower surfaces of the film which appears to drive cracking. Similar images of films dried on a liquid mercury surface, which do not crack, showed identical arrangements of particles at the top and bottom surfaces. Extending and confirming this hypothesis we show that when the elastic modulus of the substrate becomes comparable to the stresses measured in the films, the crack spacing is significantly altered. A simple model is developed which allows prediction of the crack length scale as a function of film thickness and substrate modulus"

Using high speed photography of 2 µm fluorescent tracer particles suspended in the fluid, the velocity field was measured as a function of time and radial position. The potential of the technique is illustrated using velocimetry measurements of drops of pure water and aqueous solutions of 200ppm poly-(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Dilute solutions of PEO have been known for some time to suppress the rebound of water from hydrophobic surfaces. The dissipation has traditionally been attributed to an increased extensional viscosity as the polymers stretch in the extensional flow of the droplet. Our results enable us to infer that the extensional viscosity of PEO drops, during both the spreading and retraction phase, is similar to that of pure water. The data suggests that the true source of dissipation lies at the droplet edge. We also show, by analysing the spreading of water drops, that the Roisman-Yarin theory for a droplet spreading",

High speed photography of the fluid shows evidence of dilatancy and granulation, leading finally to fracture at a critical strain rate (see figure). Finally we investigate an intriguing aspect of thin fluid filaments of the colloidal suspension, when stretched below the critical strain rate required to produce jamming.

In this study we call into question the current understanding of the anti-rebound mechanism and suggest an alternative",
      "full":"When a water drop falls on to a hydrophobic surface, such as the waxy leaf of a plant, the drop is often observed to bounce off leading to wasted agrochemicals which harm the environment. However, for about 10 years it has been known that the addition of very small quantities (~100 µgml-1) of a flexible polymer such as poly-(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can completely prevent rebound. This is surprising since the shear viscosity and surface tension of such drops are almost identical to those of pure water. The effect has for some time been explained in terms of the stretching of polymer chains by a velocity gradient in the fluid, resulting in a transient increase in the so-called “extensional viscosity”. We have developed an epi-fluorescent microscope system, complete with a pulsed laser and high speed camera which enabled visualisation of the flow of fluid inside an impacting drop using fluorescent tracer particles at 2000 frames/sec. Analysis of the velocity as a function of radius showed negligible differences between pure water and PEO drops except near the drop edge, indicating that the extensional viscosity cannot be responsible for the anti-rebound effect. To probe the true mechanism, fluorescently labelled λ-DNA in PEO drops was used to visualise the edge of an impacting drop. During drop impact, in the retraction phase, DNA was shown to be stretched by the retreating droplet providing an “effective friction” at the contact line. A careful study of the motion of the drop edge as a function of polymer concentration also supports this picture.      A better understanding of the mechanism responsible for the rebound suppression will aid in the design of more effective additives, for the agrochemical industry but also in other important commercial applications such as inkjet printing and spray cooling."

Interest in aggregates that precede fibril nucleation has been growing due to the suggestion that these aggregates rather than mature fibrils may be the important species that result in cell death. These 'prefibrils' were found to be reversible, such that if the temperature was lowered they slowly returned to native, isolated protein. Through varying the concentrations of these prefibrils we were able to show that they are directly on the nucleation pathway of mature fibrils and hence represent an important intermediate between native insulin and the fibril nucleus."

      "full":"Many studies of amyloid fibril formation are conducted in vitro where the protein is in bulk solution. However, in any physiological scenario surfaces are ubiquitous. In this study we wanted to try and quantify what effect a surface had on the propensity for fibril nucleation and growth. Using FTIR spectroscopy the conformation of protein molecules can be measured. Proteins undergo a conformational change upon forming fibrils from a native state composed largely of 'alpha helices' to a 'Beta-sheet' rich phase. By monitoring the changes in conformation we were able to follow the process of aggregation. Measurements made in a transmission cell probed the bulk behaviour whilst surface sensitive measurements were made using Attentuated Total Reflectance spectroscopy. ATR is a form of FTIR where IR is totally internally reflected at the surface of a crystal. This results in an evanescent field which is only sensitive to material within a few hundred nm of the interface. By measuring the formation of Beta-sheet it was possible to extract nucleation and growth rates at different temperatures. The kinetics were found to be Arrhenius, enabling the extraction of energy barriers for the process. The fibrils formed at the surface had similar nucleation energy barriers, but were found to display a much higher attempt frequency resulting in a higher nucleation rate. However, growth at the surface was suppressed."

      "full":"The polymer bilayers in this study were formed on silicon wafers and consisted of a Poly-ethylene oxide underlayer (semi-crystalline polymer) and a Poly-styrene overlayer (amorphous polymer). The samples were then heated to 70°C. The glass transition of the PS layer is higher than 70 and hence remains solid. By contrast the PEO layer is molten at 70. AFM of the PEO films showed that they were rough. Upon melting the liquid layer pulls the PS layer flat resulting in a compressive stress in the upper film. In order to relieve this stress the PS layer buckles. However, in order to buckle the underlayer must flow over a certain lengthscale. This viscous flow hinders the growth of large wavelengths. The competition between the two desired lengthscales results in a wrinkling lengthscale set by kinetic rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Altering the relative thicknesses of the two layers changes the bending energy of the upper film and the viscous drag of the lower film resulting in a tuneable wavelength."
